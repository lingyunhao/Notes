### Lecture 3

#####Markov Decision Process

 Current state is only related to the previous state

MDP > MRP > MP

MP : Markov Process

MRP : Markov Reward Proocess

MDP : Markov Decison Process

S - states

P - state transition matrix  Ps,s' = P (St+1 = S' | St = S)

R - reward function R S->R Rs = E[Rt+1 | St = S]

p = [[0, 0.7, 0.3], [0.9, 0, 0.1], [0.9, 0.1, 0]] (state: sleep, read, party)

### Recitation : Docker

docker build -t test.image .

You have to name the image (tag command) under your docker userid - lingyunh/test_iamge if you have the access denied issue
